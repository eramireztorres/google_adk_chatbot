# Sequential agents[¶](#sequential-agents "Permanent link")

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0Go v0.1.0Java v0.2.0

The `SequentialAgent` is a [workflow agent](../) that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in the list.
Use the `SequentialAgent` when you want the execution to occur in a fixed, strict order.

### Example[¶](#example "Permanent link")

* You want to build an agent that can summarize any webpage, using two tools: `Get Page Contents` and `Summarize Page`. Because the agent must always call `Get Page Contents` before calling `Summarize Page` (you can't summarize from nothing!), you should build your agent using a `SequentialAgent`.

As with other [workflow agents](../), the `SequentialAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are concerned only with their execution (i.e. in sequence), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.

### How it works[¶](#how-it-works "Permanent link")

When the `SequentialAgent`'s `Run Async` method is called, it performs the following actions:

1. **Iteration:** It iterates through the sub agents list in the order they were provided.
2. **Sub-Agent Execution:** For each sub-agent in the list, it calls the sub-agent's `Run Async` method.

![Sequential Agent](../../../assets/sequential-agent.png)

### Full Example: Code Development Pipeline[¶](#full-example-code-development-pipeline "Permanent link")

Consider a simplified code development pipeline:

* **Code Writer Agent:** An LLM Agent that generates initial code based on a specification.
* **Code Reviewer Agent:** An LLM Agent that reviews the generated code for errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices. It receives the output of the Code Writer Agent.
* **Code Refactorer Agent:** An LLM Agent that takes the reviewed code (and the reviewer's comments) and refactors it to improve quality and address issues.

A `SequentialAgent` is perfect for this:

```python
SequentialAgent(sub_agents=[CodeWriterAgent, CodeReviewerAgent, CodeRefactorerAgent])
```

This ensures the code is written, *then* reviewed, and *finally* refactored, in a strict, dependable order. **The output from each sub-agent is passed to the next by storing them in state via [Output Key](../../llm-agents/#structuring-data-input_schema-output_schema-output_key)**.

Shared Invocation Context

The `SequentialAgent` passes the same `InvocationContext` to each of its sub-agents. This means they all share the same session state, including the temporary (`temp:`) namespace, making it easy to pass data between steps within a single turn.
