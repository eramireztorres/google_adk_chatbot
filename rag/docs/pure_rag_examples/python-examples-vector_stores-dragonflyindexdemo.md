# Dragonfly and Vector Store

In this notebook we are going to show a quick demo of using the Dragonfly with Vector Store.

If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```python
%pip install -U llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-redis llama-index-embeddings-cohere llama-index-embeddings-openai
```

```python
import os



import getpass



import sys



import logging



import textwrap



import warnings



warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")



logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)



from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader



from llama_index.vector_stores.redis import RedisVectorStore
```

### Start Dragonfly

[Section titled “Start Dragonfly”](#start-dragonfly)

The easiest way to start Dragonfly is using the Dragonfly docker image or
quickly signing up for a [Dragonfly Cloud](https://www.dragonflydb.io/cloud) demo instance.

To follow every step of this tutorial, launch the image as follows:

Terminal window

```python
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name dragonfly docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly
```

### Setup OpenAI

[Section titled “Setup OpenAI”](#setup-openai)

Lets first begin by adding the openai api key. This will allow us to access openai for embeddings and to use chatgpt.

```python
oai_api_key = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")



os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = oai_api_key
```

Download Data

```python
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'



!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'
```

```python

```

### Read in a dataset

[Section titled “Read in a dataset”](#read-in-a-dataset)

Here we will use a set of Paul Graham essays to provide the text to turn into embeddings, store in a vector store and query to find context for our LLM QnA loop.

```python
# load documents



documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()



print(



"Document ID:",



documents[0].id_,



"Document Filename:",



documents[0].metadata["file_name"],



)
```

```python
Document ID: a5cae17c-27eb-411e-8967-fb6ef98bcdcf Document Filename: paul_graham_essay.txt
```

### Initialize the default vector store

[Section titled “Initialize the default vector store”](#initialize-the-default-vector-store)

Now we have our documents prepared, we can initialize the vector store with **default** settings. This will allow us to store our vectors in Dragonfly and create an index for real-time search.

```python
from llama_index.core import StorageContext



from redis import Redis



# create a client connection



redis_client = Redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")



# create the vector store wrapper



vector_store = RedisVectorStore(redis_client=redis_client, overwrite=True)



# load storage context



storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)



# build and load index from documents and storage context



index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(



documents, storage_context=storage_context



)
```

```python
14:41:29 llama_index.vector_stores.redis.base INFO   Using default RedisVectorStore schema.



14:41:31 httpx INFO   HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"



14:41:31 llama_index.vector_stores.redis.base INFO   Added 22 documents to index llama_index
```

### Query the default vector store

[Section titled “Query the default vector store”](#query-the-default-vector-store)

Now that we have our data stored in the index, we can ask questions against the index.

The index will use the data as the knowledge base for an LLM. The default setting for as\_query\_engine() utilizes OpenAI embeddings and GPT as the language model. Therefore, an OpenAI key is required unless you opt for a customized or local language model.

Below we will test searches against out index and then full RAG with an LLM.

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()



retriever = index.as_retriever()
```

```python
result_nodes = retriever.retrieve("What did the author learn?")



for node in result_nodes:



print(node)
```

```python

### Use a custom index schema

[Section titled “Use a custom index schema”](#use-a-custom-index-schema)

In most use cases, you need the ability to customize the underling index configuration
and specification. For example, this is handy in order to define specific metadata filters you wish to enable.

With Dragonfly, this is as simple as defining an index schema object
(from file or dict) and passing it through to the vector store client wrapper.

For this example, we will:

1. switch the embedding model to [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)
2. add an additional metadata field for the document `updated_at` timestamp
3. index the existing `file_name` metadata field

```python
from llama_index.core.settings import Settings



from llama_index.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbedding



# set up Cohere Key



co_api_key = getpass.getpass("Cohere API Key:")



Settings.embed_model = CohereEmbedding(api_key=co_api_key)
```

```python
from redisvl.schema import IndexSchema



custom_schema = IndexSchema.from_dict(



{



# customize basic index specs



"index": {



"name": "paul_graham",



"prefix": "essay",



"key_separator": ":",



},



# customize fields that are indexed



"fields": [



# required fields for llamaindex



{"type": "tag", "name": "id"},



{"type": "tag", "name": "doc_id"},



{"type": "text", "name": "text"},



# custom metadata fields



{"type": "numeric", "name": "updated_at"},



{"type": "tag", "name": "file_name"},



# custom vector field definition for cohere embeddings



{



"type": "vector",



"name": "vector",



"attrs": {



"dims": 1024,



"algorithm": "hnsw",



"distance_metric": "cosine",



},



},



],



}



)
```

```python
custom_schema.index
```

```python
IndexInfo(name='paul_graham', prefix='essay', key_separator=':', storage_type=<StorageType.HASH: 'hash'>)
```

```python
custom_schema.fields
```

```python

def date_to_timestamp(date_string: str) -> int:



date_format: str = "%Y-%m-%d"



return int(datetime.strptime(date_string, date_format).timestamp())



# iterate through documents and add new field



for document in documents:



document.metadata["updated_at"] = date_to_timestamp(



document.metadata["last_modified_date"]



)
```

```python
vector_store = RedisVectorStore(

redis_client=redis_client,



overwrite=True,



)



storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)



# build and load index from documents and storage context

documents, storage_context=storage_context

```

### Query the vector store and filter on metadata

[Section titled “Query the vector store and filter on metadata”](#query-the-vector-store-and-filter-on-metadata)

Now that we have additional metadata indexed in Dragonfly, let’s try some queries with filters.

```python
from llama_index.core.vector_stores import (



MetadataFilters,



MetadataFilter,



ExactMatchFilter,



)



retriever = index.as_retriever(



similarity_top_k=3,



filters=MetadataFilters(



filters=[



ExactMatchFilter(key="file_name", value="paul_graham_essay.txt"),



MetadataFilter(



key="updated_at",



value=date_to_timestamp("2023-01-01"),



operator=">=",



),



MetadataFilter(



key="text",



value="learn",



operator="text_match",



),



],



condition="and",



),



)
```

```python
result_nodes = retriever.retrieve("What did the author learn?")



for node in result_nodes:



print(node)
```

```python
14:42:37 httpx INFO   HTTP Request: POST https://api.cohere.com/v2/embed "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

### Deleting documents or index completely

[Section titled “Deleting documents or index completely”](#deleting-documents-or-index-completely)

Sometimes it may be useful to delete documents or the entire index. This can be done using the `delete` and `delete_index` methods.

```python
document_id = documents[0].doc_id



document_id
```

```python
print("Number of documents before deleting", redis_client.dbsize())



vector_store.delete(document_id)



print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())
```

However, the index still exists (with no associated documents).

```python
vector_store.index_exists()
```

```python
# now lets delete the index entirely



# this will delete all the documents and the index



vector_store.delete_index()
```

```python
print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())
```
