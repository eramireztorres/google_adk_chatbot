The retrieval context does not support any of the sentences in the expected output, leading to a low score.\nQuery: 'Give the Python example of a Function Tool with required parameters city and unit from the ADK function tools documentation.' -> Low contextual_recall (0.67): The score is 0.67 because the first two sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes 2 and 3, which contain the function definition and its description, but the remaining sentences are unrelated to the nodes, leading to a moderate confidence in the attribution."
