      "critique": "Framework: Llama\nQuery: 'Provide the Python code from the ADK quickstart that defines the get_current_time tool and the root_agent.' -> Low answer_relevancy (0.62): The score is 0.62 because some parts of the output, such as explanations about expected function outputs and unrelated import statements, are irrelevant to the actual code definitions. However, the core code for 'get_current_time' and 'root_agent' is present, which justifies the partial relevance and prevents a lower score.\nQuery: 'Provide the Python code from the ADK quickstart that defines the get_current_time tool and the root_agent.' -> Low contextual_recall (0.12): The score is 0.12 because the only sentence in the expected output that directly relates to the retrieval context is the first, which mentions 'Install ADK by running the following command', aligning with node 1 in the context. The remaining sentences are not supported by the context, leading to a low recall score.\nQuery: 'Give the Python example of a Function Tool with required parameters city and unit from the ADK function tools documentation.' -> Low answer_relevancy (0.62): The score is 0.62 because the response included irrelevant details about weather reports instead of providing the Python example of the Function Tool with 'city' and 'unit' parameters as requested. However, it partially addressed the request, which is why the score isn't lower.\nQuery: 'Show the Python example that registers a before_model callback in an LlmAgent.' -> Low answer_relevancy (0.38): The score is 0.38 because the output contains several irrelevant statements about importing modules and setting properties that do not directly demonstrate registering a before_model callback, which limits its relevance despite some related context.\nQuery: 'From the MCP tools documentation, provide the Python agent.py sample that connects to a local filesystem MCP server started via npx and exposes its tools through MCPToolset.' -> Low contextual_recall (0.50): The score is 0.50 because the context mentions 'os.path.abspath(TARGET_FOLDER_PATH)' used in args, indicating the path is relevant, which supports sentence 13 in the expected output. However, the context lacks specific sentences that directly correspond to other parts of the output, leading to a moderate confidence in attribution."
