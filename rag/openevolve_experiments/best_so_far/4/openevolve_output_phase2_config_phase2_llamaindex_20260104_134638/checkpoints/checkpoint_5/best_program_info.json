      "critique": "Framework: Llama\nQuery: 'Provide the Python code from the ADK quickstart that defines the get_current_time tool and the root_agent.' -> Low contextual_recall (0.00): The score is 0.00 because the expected output code about a time-telling agent does not relate to the context, which discusses agent project structure and API setup, indicating no relevant connection.\nQuery: 'Give the Python example of a Function Tool with required parameters city and unit from the ADK function tools documentation.' -> Low answer_relevancy (0.45): The score is 0.45 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements about docstrings and descriptions that do not directly address providing a Python example of the Function Tool with specified parameters, thus limiting its relevance.\nQuery: 'Give the Python example of a Function Tool with required parameters city and unit from the ADK function tools documentation.' -> Low contextual_recall (0.67): The score is 0.67 because the first two sentences in the expected output are well supported by the retrieval context, which discusses a weather retrieval function, while the third sentence, about function logic and return statement, is less directly supported, leading to a moderate confidence in the attribution.\nQuery: 'Show the Python example that registers a before_model callback in an LlmAgent.' -> Low faithfulness (0.00): The score is 0.00 because the actual output introduces specific details such as 'llm_agent' being assigned 'LlmAgent('.', comments about 'Other agent parameters...', and the function name 'my_before_model_logic', none of which are supported by the retrieval context. The context only mentions 'before_model_callback' as a parameter assigned to a function and that 'my_before_model_logic' is a function, without additional details or comments, leading to contradictions.\nQuery: 'From the MCP tools documentation, provide the Python agent.py sample that connects to a local filesystem MCP server started via npx and exposes its tools through MCPToolset.' -> Low faithfulness (0.00): The score is 0.00 because the actual output contains contradictions such as claiming module imports from 'google.adk.agents' and 'google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset', which are not supported by the context, and stating that 'PATH_TO_YOUR_MCP_SERVER_SCRIPT' is set to a specific path, whereas the context indicates it's a placeholder to be replaced. These discrepancies show the output is not faithful to the context."
